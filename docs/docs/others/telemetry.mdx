# Data collected
Twenty records pageview events using a unique identifier for each workspace/user, and collects the workspace's domain.
Twenty does not use cookies for telemetry or collect email addresses, names, phone numbers, dates of birth, addresses, usernames, or other PII.

# Opting-out of telemetry
To disable telemetry in your workspace, add the following line to your `server/.env` file:
```
TELEMETRY_ANONYMIZATION_ENABLED=false
```
